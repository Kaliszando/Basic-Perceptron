# Basic-Perceptron
Perceptron can solve linear separable problem. In this project perceptron train on data with given labels and then it can predict with particular probabilty, class of a given input. Perceptron have two inputs: x1 and x2, wich represents vector of inputs in space. Perceptron also uses external bias.
I used 2D graph to visualise the algoritm. Each point (x,y) represents a vector of inputs. Line is representig the output from perceptron.
